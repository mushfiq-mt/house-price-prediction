**Project: House Price Prediction**

**Description:** This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. The model is built and trained on a dataset. The trained model is then deployed as a web application using Flask, HTML, and CSS.

**About the dataset:**
Features:
1. Square_Footage: The size of the house in square feet. Larger homes typically have higher prices.
2. Num_Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house. More bedrooms generally increase the value of a home.
3. Num_Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house. Houses with more bathrooms are typically priced higher.
4. Year_Built: The year the house was built. Older houses may be priced lower due to wear and tear.
5. Lot_Size: The size of the lot the house is built on, measured in acres. Larger lots tend to add value to a property.
6. Garage_Size: The number of cars that can fit in the garage. Houses with larger garages are usually more expensive.
7. Neighborhood_Quality: A rating of the neighborhoodâ€™s quality on a scale of 1-10, where 10 indicates a high-quality neighborhood. Better neighborhoods usually command higher prices.
8. House_Price (Target Variable): The price of the house, which is the dependent variable you aim to predict.
